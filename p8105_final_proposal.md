**Tentative project title**:Price Analysis and Prediction

**Motivation**:Â Avocado has become a more preferable and healthy choice
as a source of fat nutrition source. According to USDA, U.S. demand for
avocados has increased steadily over the past two decades. Per capita
consumption of avocados has tripled since 2001 to 8 pounds per person in
2018. We want to perform EDA to the original dataset and implement a
prediction model of prices.

**Intended final products**:  
Thus, in this project, our goals are: Assess the relationship between
the size of an avocado and price. The general trend of avocado volume
and price over time. Create an interactive map of prices and volumes of
avocado in the U.S. Implement a prediction model to accurately forecast
Avocado prices.

The final product will be a well-formatted website, including a video
presentation, written report, and the display of our data source, data
analysis, interactive visualization, prediction model.

**Data sources**:  
The dataset, updated till March, 2018, was compiled by Justin Kiggins
who obtained the data source from \[Hass Avocado Board\]
(<https://hassavocadoboard.com/>). It can be accessed at \[Kaggle\]
(<https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices>).

**Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**:  
The data will be manipulated through `tidyverse`, `stringr`, and
`forcat` packages, and the exploratory analysis will be conducted for
statistics summaries through `group_by` and `summary` functions.
Visualizations will be used to show the trends and associations of the
variables through `ggplot`. In addition, the plots will be displayed for
interactivity on websites through `plotly` and `flexdashboard`.

**Planned timeline**:  
Nov 20: data analysis and visualization (trends and EDAs) Dec 4: report,
webpage, video screencast
