## Tentative project title
Avocado Price Analysis and Prediction

## Motivation
Avocado has become a more preferable and healthy choice as a source of fat nutrition source. According to USDA, U.S. demand for avocados has increased steadily over the past two decades. Per capita consumption of avocados has tripled since 2001 to 8 pounds per person in 2018. We believe that by looking into influential factors and trends regarding avocado prices, we could gain more insights into its consumption apattern and further predict its impact on people's life and health. 

We want to perform EDA to the original data and implement a prediction model of prices. We also intend to include interactive visualization tool that will enable people to check on time-base or region-base information purposefully.  

## Intended final products
* Quantified relationship between the size of an avocado and price
* General trends of avocado volume and price (by regions) over time
* Interactive maps of prices vs. volumes and prices vs. region of avocado in the U.S
* Prediction model to accurately forecast avocado prices

The final product will be a well-formatted website, including a video presentation, written report, and the display of our data analysis, interactive visualization, and prediction model.

## Data sources
The dataset, updated till March, 2018, was compiled by Justin Kiggins who obtained the data source from [Hass Avocado Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com/). It can be accessed at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices).

## Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
* The data will be cleaned, manipulated and summarized through `tidyverse`, `stringr`, `forcat` and other neccessary packages. 
* Visualizations will be used to show the interested trends and associations of the variables through `ggplot`. In addition, the plots will be displayed for interactivity on websites through `plotly` and `shiny`. 
* Implementing several regression models based on our EDA and select the most accurate one for price prediction.

## Planned timeline
* Milestone 1: Tidying Data (Nov 10 - Nov 15)
    + Proposal approved after review meeting
    + Date cleaning and data wrangling 
  
* Milestone 2: EDA  (Nov 16 - Nov 22)
    + Initial data exploration/visualization 
    + Further data visualizations/conclusions
  
* Milestone 3: Building up deliverables (Nov 23 - Nov 30)
    + Interactive visualization
    + Report, website wrap-up and screencast
  
* Milestone 4: Assembling (Dec 1 - Dec 4)
    + Finish up deliverables
    + Proofread
    + Done!
