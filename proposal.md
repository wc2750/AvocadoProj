**Tentative project title**:  
Avocado Price Analysis and Prediction

**Motivation**:  
Avocado has become a more preferable and healthy choice as a source of
fat nutrition source. According to USDA, U.S. demand for avocados has
increased steadily over the past two decades. Per capita consumption of
avocados has tripled since 2001 to 8 pounds per person in 2018. We want
to perform EDA to the original dataset and implement a prediction model
of prices.

**Intended final products**:  
In this project, our goals are to:  
\* Assess the relationship between the size of an avocado and price.  
\* Generate the general trends of avocado volume and price (by regions)
over time.  
\* Create an interactive map of prices and volumes of avocado in the
U.S.  
\* Implement a prediction model to accurately forecast Avocado prices.

The final product will be a well-formatted website, including a video
presentation, written report, and the display of our data analysis,
interactive visualization, and prediction model.

**Data sources**:  
The dataset, updated till March, 2018, was compiled by Justin Kiggins
who obtained the data source from [Hass Avocado
Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com/). It can be accessed at
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices).

**Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**:  
The data will be cleaned, manipulated and summarized through
`tidyverse`, `stringr`, `forcat` and other neccessary packages.
Visualizations will be used to show the interested trends and
associations of the variables through `ggplot`. In addition, the plots
will be displayed for interactivity on websites through `plotly` and
`shiny`. Also, we plan to take challenges in implementing several
regression models based on our EDA and select the most accurate one for
price prediction.

**Planned timeline**:  
Nov 20: data analysis and visualization (trends and EDAs)  
Dec 4: report, webpage, video screencast
